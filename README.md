# Poker Solitaire

A simple text-based (TUI) implementation of **Poker Solitaire**, also known as Poker Squares.  
The goal of the game is to arrange 25 cards into a 5Ã—5 grid to form the best possible poker hands across rows and columns.

## How to play

1. You are dealt one card at a time. 
2. Place each card into an empty space in the 5x5 grid.
3. Once all 25 spaces are filled, each row and column is scored as a poker hand.
4. The total score is the sum of all rows and columns.

## How to build & run the game

1. Run this line in your terminal:
